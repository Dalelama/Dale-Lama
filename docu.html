            <b>First Assignment</b><br><br>
            My first assignment from web development class was to manipulate the layout and the content to my imagination exploring different websites. At first, I was a kind of thinking why are we even doing this? Later I learned how powerful the console is to perform different action and get different result. I went back to the link the professor provided and followed the instructions and I also did some online research. Later I was able to project my imagination onto the news front page by applying some console techniques. I changed the headlines to give it a different meaning and filled up the content with made of story and news. I was also able to change the background colour and replace the images. That was really fun.
            I also enjoyed reading a brief introduction of website with an insightful thought along with a nice story. Back in days people used to build their house with tiny window later they discover the benefits of having bigger and multiple windows was to receive enough lights in the house and be able to see more things that are happening outside the house, without having to step out of the house. I think this very principle was applied to the platform what we know as website today. Website has developed its architecture very intensive over the time for a simple reason that people want their website to be their home, their world what ever you call it. A musician wants his website to be a studio. An athlete wants his or her website to be stadium. A filmmaker wants his or her website to be the theatre. Basically, people want to live in their world that they are passionate about at comfortable and convenient environment. So, your house can be your shifting house next the beach too.

            <b>Second Assignment</b><br><br>
            My second assignment was to develop an interaction of cards shuffling employing the JavaScript array and loop method. I spent one whole day to create card images using adobe illustrator. I spent several days to figure out the way to random shuffle my cards but no success. Now, I had three other assignments from three different classes to worry about. The professor had told me to reach her out through email upon any difficulties. Unfortunately, I was not using the right email address to contact my professor. I sent whole bunch of emails but no response. I really was going through a nightmare. I did not stop doing research online. I went through several different strategies and made countless attempts. Finally, I was able to randomize the shuffling of numbers and letters but failed to print the images on html page. On my next class I went to my professor and she helped me to print the image of array to the html. I guess this is how we learn.
            <b>Prof. Dr. Style</b> I find this really interesting their perspective of interface design. When you look at their interface designs on their websites you may find something lacking or missing but It still surprises me that they did not have these newly developed tools that handles and accomplishes the sophisticated tasks yet they were able to do all their works? I can imagine them being really patient and passionate to what they did. Their icons, gif images, horizontal lines or borders, and table in a way looks a kind of outdated but I appreciate it. Also, a lot of tools that they were using then do not seem to have worked as intended or say full of glitches. For example, the CMS that they were using for their complex projects would not monitor the link that is taken to. However, I think they had done a great deal of works that made our task easier to step up right from there.

            <b>Third Assignment</b><br><br>
            My third assignment was to create a remote API request for certain task and write script to project it on my page. Seemingly everything is happening right on my page but that is just a reflection of the site that I get the API from which is very interesting to me. I spend a lot of time on this assignment too. You know when you don’t have a background knowledge or say don’t have a clue, but trying to mimic the work that professor went over for about an hour….. A small unfamiliar think can drive you crazy. But this time I did not have to struggle as much as I had to do with my second assignment. I pulled out a lot of videos and online resources and was able to get the job done as anticipated.
            <b>It was raining in the data centre</b> is interesting to learn about the big picture of the data network and its infrastructure across the country, but it is also frightening at the same time. If something happened to it that would cripple the whole operation of human society which ultimately may lead to the threat to the country. The facility could be very distant and undergrounded but it is exposed to every device that we use. So, when the cloud touches us, we also become a part of the network.
            I liked the idea of <b>The Stealth Infrastructure</b>. It may not always at every place be safe but making effort to keep it out of site for safety purpose is good thing to do.
            <b>Anatomy of AI System</b> After reading the AI system I wanted to throw some of these good and bad sides.
            Advantages of AI System: -
            1.) Artificial Intelligence helps us in reducing the error & the chances of reaching Accuracy with a greater degree of precision is a possibility.
            2.) Artificial Intelligence is widely employed by Financial Institutions & banking Institutions to organize and manage data.
            3.) Artificial Intelligence & the science of robotics can be put to use in mining & other fuel exploration processes. Due to the programming of robots, they can perform more laborious & hard work with greater responsibility.
            4.) Repetitive jobs which are monotonous in nature can be carried out with the help of machine intelligence.
            5.) Machines, unlike humans, do not require frequent breaks & refreshments. They are programmed for long hours & can continuously perform without getting bored or distracted or even tired.
            <b>Disadvantages of AI System</b>:-
            1.) Creation of Artificial Intelligence requires huge costs as they are very complex machines. Their repairs and maintenance require huge cost.
            2.) Replacement of humans with machines can lead to large-scale unemployment.
            3.) Machines are unable to alter their responses to changing environments. Unlike humans, artificial intelligence cannot be improved with experience.
            4.) Machines do not have any emotions and moral values. They perform what is programmed & cannot make the judgement of right or wrong.
            The Cute Cat Theory: This is good if you are an activist. Those who are not into politics don’t identify as activist and do not engage with politics. But, like Americans and Europeans, they are interested in seeing cute cates being adorable online. When the government blocks Daily Motion, it impacts those who are not politically active. Cute cats are collateral damage when governments block sites. And even those who are not bothered with presidential dishonest are made aware that their government fear online speech so much that they’re willing to censor the millions of phony videos on Daily Motion to block a few political ones.

            <b>Fourth Assignment</b><br><br>
            My other assignment was to write the code for get request and the post request. On this I spent way more time and effort to get the work done. Following online tutorial and instructions, I made several attempt with different strategies. I completed pretty much everything including styling and all that. But at last minute I don’t know what went wrong, I could not get the post back.

            <b>Slime Mold Intelligence</b><br><br>
            I have seen kids playing with slime and I have heard of it but, I guess this was something altogether different. It is really amazing. Single cell and no brain? Let’s hope that this is not going to prove that it is not the brain that does all the thought process in our head but its something else, in near future. I found this very interesting.

            Well scientists are wonder if the slime mold could do more than just a full trailer tricks in England. Marcus recreates an experiment at Tokyo University. He puts oat flakes surrounding the Slime mold and what happens next is recorded by time lapse camera in the middle. Slim mold spreads out and colonize the whole of the dish finding all the oat flakes that they positioned earlier in there, around. Connects each of those food resources. Some of the links disappear and some of them are strengthened. what this slime mold has done is truly remarkable. The way they set out those oat flakes was not entirely random. The central block is supposed to represent Tokyo and if they reposition all the major cities around Tokyo so what it turned out to form was not just the slime mold exploring a random distribution of oat flakes but the spread maps out the region around Tokyo. slime mold connects all of those cities the way humans would have connected it with that round that way when you compare the local Tokyo rail system and the network of the slime molds come up with the two designs are remarkably similar in just a few hours the slime mold has done most skilled Engineers took years to achieve it just found the most efficient way to link together multiple locations which is effective as the well-organized Tokyo rail system slime mold doesn't have a brain or any way of calculating this I need to produce a net with very similar properties.
